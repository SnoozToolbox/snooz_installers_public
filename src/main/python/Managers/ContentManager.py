    """ ContentManager manages the life-cycle of the main content of the application.
    
    There are three type of content: process content, tool content and app content.
    
    The process content is the content that will be displayed in the process tab. The schema
    block made of interconnected modules.

    The tool content is the content that will be displayed in the tool tab. The step-by-step
    interface.

    The app content is the content that will be displayed in the app tab.

    Whenever the user is requesting to load a process, a tool or an app, the content manager will
    ask the user if there is something to be saved. If not, it will unload the previous content 
    and load the new one.

    The content manager is not responsible for the actual content. It only manages the life cycle of
    the content.

    Note: A tool is always associated with a process. A process can run alone
    and is not always associated with a tool. This means that if we are loading
     a process, we must first unload any tool that was loaded first.

    Only one app can be loaded at a time. An app is independent from other tools and processes.
    Therefore when an app is loaded, the current opened tool or process are ignored.
