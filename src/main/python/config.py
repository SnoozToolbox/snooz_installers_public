When configuring the application's settings under QSettings, it creates new folder (key) with said settings in the OS system.

In Windows, open the Registry Editor, then: Computer>HKEY_CURRENT_USER>Software>CEAMS>Snooz

In macOS, in a terminal, look under ~/Library/Preferences/, you can then inspect that directory and look for "ceams" with the following
command: `ls | grep ceams`, you should then see a or multiple .plist files, those are the equivalent of the key folder in the Windows Registry.

When the user downloads a new version of Snooz, It is preferable to create a new settings location for that version, as some old features
may be deprecated with the new version of Snooz.

For a developer, normally fbs (pro version) should not be installed on the environment. The developer will then be able to have a common settings folder
no matter which version of Snooz he may be using.
